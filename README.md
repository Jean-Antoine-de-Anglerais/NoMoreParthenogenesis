# NoMoreParthenogenesis
This small mod fixes the breeding of civilized units. Now they can only breed if there are 2 of them and only if they are of different sexes. The gender mechanic already exists in the vanilla game, but it is only used to generate names and skins. 

This mod will also show the gender of the creature in the creature info window.

The mod is localized into Russian and English.
